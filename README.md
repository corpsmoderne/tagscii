TAG-ASCII
=========

So you're being chased. It's running faster than you, and will be upon you any second. 
What're you gonna do ? Turn into a 'b' ! 

TAG-ASCII is an online multiplayer mashup of Tag, Hide-and-seek and Etch A Sketch in ASCII. 
Your character (haha) can at any moment turn into any other alphanumeric character (a-z, 0-9). 
Run for your life and hide into forests of 'i's or moutains of 'k's. Or play as the Tag and track those annoying letters. 
Will you be able to distinguish them from their environment ? "I'm not a number - I'm a 2 !" - prisoner69
