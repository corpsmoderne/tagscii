      <h2>Basic Rules</h2>

      <p>
        The scene takes place on a map of 64x64 ASCII characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The players are represented by a black alpha-numerical ASCII character.
      </p>
      <p>
        A randomly chosen player starts to be "it" and turns red. The player selected to be "it" becomes red, then chases the others, attempting to get close enough to tag them while the others try to escape. A tag makes the tagged player "it".
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The winner is the player who has been "it" the less.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game ends when a player has been "it" for 60 seconds.
      </p>
      
      
      <h2>Tagged player’s actions</h2>
      
      <p>When tagged, "it" is stunned for 5 seconds.</p>

      <p>"It" can change the appearance of a character on the map by pressing an alpha-numerical ASCII character.</p>
      
      <h2>Chased player’s actions</h2>
      
      <p>The players trying to escape can switch their appearance by pressing a key.</p>
      
      <p>The players turn green if hiding for too long.</p>
      
      <p>Players are considered hidden if they stay still or if they are on a character matching their appearance.</p>
